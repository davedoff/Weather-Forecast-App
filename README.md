# Weather Forecast App
This Android app provides users with a 10-day weather forecast for a specified location using SMHI Open Data, Volley, and JSON. Users can easily enter their desired location and view time, temperature, and cloud coverage information. The app also includes a feature that allows users to save multiple favorite locations for quick access, accessible through a separate view. The app was developed as part of a mobile applications and wireless networks course at Kungliga Tekniska HÃ¶gskolan.

The app is built using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, providing a well-organized structure for the codebase. This approach helps to separate the concerns of the application, making it easier to maintain and modify. Volley was used to handle network requests, allowing for efficient data retrieval from the SMHI Open Data API, which provides weather data in JSON-format.
